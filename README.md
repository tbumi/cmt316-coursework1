# CMT316 Coursework 1 Part 2

The code is provided as a Jupyter Notebook named `part2.ipynb` which can be run
in order from top to bottom.

The dataset is assumed to be in the same folder as the notebook, under the path
`datasets/bbc/`.

The only external library requirements are `pandas`, `spacy`, and
`scikit-learn`, which can be installed with the below command:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn spacy
```
